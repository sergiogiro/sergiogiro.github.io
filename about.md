I like building things. Some of them happen to be software.
I'm currently helping with Machine Learning for Code at [prodo.ai](http://prodo.ai).
It's my first time as a company founder, so I'm learning a lot!

### More Information

Before prodo.ai I was at Google, contributing to the
[Android codebase](https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/author:sgiro%2540google.com), where I contributed several fundamental java classes like
[Timer](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/libcore/+/169083)
and
[Base64](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/libcore/+/162809),
and took care of the
[security and crypto packages](https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/author:sgiro+jdk8u60)
(even getting to
[write my own crypto!](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/external/bouncycastle/+/287342/4/bcprov/src/main/java/org/bouncycastle/jcajce/provider/symmetric/PBES2AlgorithmParameters.java)
--which I normally would
[not](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/43272/why-is-writing-your-own-encryption-discouraged)),
and also [communicated changes](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/06/security-crypto-provider-deprecated-in.html)
to developers.
At some point in development I
[saved 200ms in the startup of nearly every app](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/229477),
which is a lot of time if you count how many apps are run in Android devices
each second. It feels nice to think that my code runs in many millions devices
helping many millions people.

Before Google I have several jobs in industry, interspersed with research in
academia.

I did my PhD in the area of quantitative formal analysis of probabilistic
systems, in [CÃ³rdoba, Argentina](www.famaf.unc.edu.ar). Then I've been a
Research Assistant in the
[University of Oxford](http://qav.cs.ox.ac.uk/people.php).
I've contributed several
[theoretical results](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/g/Giro:Sergio)
and implemented
[prototypes](https://github.com/sergiogiro/Prism/tree/certificate-generation)
as to show their practical impact.
