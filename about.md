I like building things. Some of them happen to be software.

### More Information

Before working on ML for code I was at Google, contributing to the
[Android codebase](https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/author:sgiro%2540google.com){:target="_blank"}, where I contributed several fundamental java classes like
[Timer](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/libcore/+/169083){:target="_blank"}
and
[Base64](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/libcore/+/162809){:target="_blank"},
took also care of the
[security and crypto packages](https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/author:sgiro+jdk8u60){:target="_blank"}
(even getting to
[write my own crypto!](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/external/bouncycastle/+/287342/4/bcprov/src/main/java/org/bouncycastle/jcajce/provider/symmetric/PBES2AlgorithmParameters.java){:target="_blank"}
--which I normally would
[not](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/43272/why-is-writing-your-own-encryption-discouraged){:target="_blank"}),
and [communicated changes](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/06/security-crypto-provider-deprecated-in.html){:target="_blank"}
to developers.
At some point in development I
[saved 200ms in the startup of nearly every app](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/229477){:target="_blank"},
which amounts to several years if you count how many apps are run in Android
devices each second. It feels nice to think that my code runs in many millions
devices helping many millions people.

Before Google I have several jobs in industry, interspersed with research in
academia.

I did my PhD in the area of quantitative formal analysis of probabilistic
systems, in [CÃ³rdoba, Argentina](www.famaf.unc.edu.ar){:target="_blank"}. Then I've been a
Research Assistant at the
[University of Oxford](http://qav.cs.ox.ac.uk/people.php){:target="_blank"}.
I've contributed several
[theoretical results](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/g/Giro:Sergio){:target="_blank"}
and implemented
[prototypes](https://github.com/sergiogiro/Prism/tree/certificate-generation){:target="_blank"}
as to show their practical impact.
